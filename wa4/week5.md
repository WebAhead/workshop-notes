Mario: CSS is always a thing that you will learn, it;s always on the improving
Shireen: i'll send resources.


#### - More about deploying
Mahmood: we need to know more about deploying and real life examples

Mario: Heroku is really good for deployment the lower level of the abstraction that heroku builds on is very hard to understand, what works on the computer also does the same on any other server.



#### - More time for testing
Hadeel : i think we need more time on testing cause we didn't or we don't know how to do it properly
Najwan: the point of this projects this week was to test the server and handle errors which we didn't do much, we just focused on the main functionality, so we have to focus on the requirments and writing the tests.

Fatme: but the api was problematic

Mario: that is not an excuse for me you don't understand what is testing if you are saying that.

#### - more photos videos in the workshop
Mahmooud: it's fine to have tons of text, but we should have pictures to help us understand better, visually.
