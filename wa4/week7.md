### - Retreat vacation

- Rabea: like go together to vacation, to change enviroment, but then i thought no one would agree to this (lol) so a vacation in general. are we going to visits more companies?
- Shireen: bureaucracy in companies is brutal. in 2/3 elections day is off. if you want 2 days off then the design week would be very stressful.
- Rabea: what do  we have the following weeks?
- Shireen: 1/3 we start desgin week, plan and design your idea with your team.
- a whole week just for planning ?
- Shireen: no code at all.
_after long discussion_
