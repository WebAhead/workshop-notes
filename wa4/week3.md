## intro to TDD:
Everyone thinks its good

## Jest WS:
6 people put (-): Yes i know how to use it, but i didnt understand the reasoning behind it.
Haven't taught us bunch of things that might be useful, wasn't very in depth.
## Roman Numerals:
Everyone Loved it.
- It was supposed to be all of it code-along but we changed it.
- Should start as a Code-along then for us to continue coding it.
## Intro to Recursion:
3(-): Didn't have enough time to finish it.
Overall it was good.
## Traffic Lights:
1(-): it was really fun, and taught us a lot.
I think Traffic lights needed to be expanded more to be more useful for us to learn more in depth setTimeOut().
## Pure Functions:
3(-): nice concept, good overall enjoyable.
## Research:
5(-): Very boring, not helpful.
It was the same materials that we went over, so everyone already knew about these subjects.
I feel like i learned only on the subject that i researched. When someone else presents something else it doesn't really help me.
## WaterFall WS:
3(-): Very Hard to understand workshop. 
I didn't feel like it was useful because we're not going to use it. but it was nice to see. 

## Projects:
all postive reviews - everyone likes it.
Makes you Understand everything you went over sink in.
Mahmod: This weeks Project - Bunch of functions were already written.
Made it really unclear for me, because seeing bunch of functions in different pages that made me lose my train of thought on which function calls what.
For Example: In logic.js something in the end of the page had a function that calls something on the first of the page that made it really hard for me to keep track!!!
