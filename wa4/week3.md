# Notes to stop Go Continue
## STOP
#### Stop Arguing Loudly: 

Rabea Apologizing for Francis for shouting at  He was not supposed to yell
####  Being Lazy: 
Stand up while presenting, Pointless - need to read it from a pc no need to stand. 
Rabea doesnt agree.
Mario - There's a need to present when standing in front of a lot of people to get used to it - helps in Public Speaking. Clicker? 
Hard to speak while someone is on the PC - Need to plan the presentation before hand.
The person on the computer needs to listen to the speaker. 
You're doing that - So i probably need to do this. Next week plan to stand up while presenting on both research and projects.
Rabea - This is your chance to learn in these 14 weeks to train for public speaking.
####  Being Kids
(mario):dont be kids in general. I have time for you but dont be annoying.
It shouldn't feel like a school setting.
need to take responsibility for our actions/self, if you end up messing up or not learning its your fault and not anyone else.

## GO
#### 09:00 - 17:00: 
democracy works, 3 people put X's Aysam/Inas/Hadeel - (mario): majority takes prior - it will pass.
Hadeel when you leave home early there might be a lot of traffic.
Francis: when we leave at 17 also there's a lot of traffic. 
Yousef; leaving around 8 am will be stuck in traffic leaving nazareth since there's school. 
Next Week: Trying out 9-17 if it's good, then it will go if not then we'll go back to our regular schedule. 

#### one page for the resources:
all the links, materials that we learn, or learned should be on the same page and not redirecting you to a bunch of other links. All the Research - Projects should be in the same place. Everything related to API be in the same place etc.

#### Team Names:
Mario input - Its nicer to see, more entertaining for mentors and teams.
Be Creative. a nice thing to add.

#### Week/Project milestones:
We hadn't enough time to do TDD - its still a new subject not sure how to do it so we need more time. Sometimes we're not doing it properly because we're tight on time.
Mario: We're Always here to help you out if something is not understood - There's a learning outcomes of doing such a thing so keep it in mind.
Milestones regard - Milestone is sometimes the answer or the solution to the project.

#### Self Motivation:
Mario will be by himself when other Facn7 will be here, so keep in mind to make sure to ask your classmates, google, and not go for me(mentor-Mario)
immediately. For example - GitHub was a problem this week, so next time instead of asking try searching for it.

#### time to plan presenations:
Najwan - We were working on the project and making sure it runs correclty and debugging it. So we didn;t have enough time to plan the presenation like it should be. So it wont be a comedy show like today. :)

#### Share tasks together:
Hadeel - I think that in every Team mates in projects, There's some that is more advanced than others, so it makes it really hard for the one who is not so advanced to keep up. For example - i worked on very little coding stuff - because i didnt have enough time to work on other things or to keep up with the advanced.
Rabea and yousef suggested that Being in a team side project one of the things to overcome is being able to communicate with your teammates.
Action Point: Mix Advanced with less advanced, make sure to communicated between each other and Ask questions, help each other.
#### Clean, Coffee Table:
Clean - Clean after yourself, a paper roll to leave it there so you can have a way to clean after yourself.
Cofee Table - Rabea suggested that we collect 20ILS from each of the classmates keep it in a piggy bank and buy whatever is missing.

#### Taking Reviews Seriously:
Najwan - I do not think that anyone doing the Review is really trying to understand the code infront of him - So we can benefit from someone elses code and someone understand my code aswell. 
How's the app working? Hows that function works?
he feels that we need to make more time for this. 
Mario - Its legitimate to open an issue on someone elses app to ask any question for something that you do not understand.

## Continue:

#### Projects: 
Great!
#### Respect:
Awesome!
#### giving feedback issues:
Very good thing - and i feel like we need to improve on it. 
And i would love for feedback on the issues that i open on a certain project.


## intro to TDD:
Everyone thinks its good

## Jest WS:
6 people put (-): Yes i know how to use it, but i didnt understand the reasoning behind it.
Haven't taught us bunch of things that might be useful, wasn't very in depth.
## Roman Numerals:
Everyone Loved it.
- It was supposed to be all of it code-along but we changed it.
- Should start as a Code-along then for us to continue coding it.
## Intro to Recursion:
3(-): Didn't have enough time to finish it.
Overall it was good.
## Traffic Lights:
1(-): it was really fun, and taught us a lot.
I think Traffic lights needed to be expanded more to be more useful for us to learn more in depth setTimeOut().
## Pure Functions:
3(-): nice concept, good overall enjoyable.
## Research:
5(-): Very boring, not helpful.
It was the same materials that we went over, so everyone already knew about these subjects.
I feel like i learned only on the subject that i researched. When someone else presents something else it doesn't really help me.
## WaterFall WS:
3(-): Very Hard to understand workshop. 
I didn't feel like it was useful because we're not going to use it. but it was nice to see. 

## Projects:
all postive reviews - everyone likes it.
Makes you Understand everything you went over sink in.
Mahmod: This weeks Project - Bunch of functions were already written.
Made it really unclear for me, because seeing bunch of functions in different pages that made me lose my train of thought on which function calls what.
For Example: In logic.js something in the end of the page had a function that calls something on the first of the page that made it really hard for me to keep track!!!
