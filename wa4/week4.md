# SGC Week 4 - FACN8

## Stop

### Doing SGC every week (can we do it every other week?)
- Narjwan: We don't have much each week, we could use time better
- Ivan: Maybe more time to projects
- Mario: SGC important, there's always something to talk about
- Rabea: I agree, maybe we can shorten it, we could have board up in morning and see how many things there are to talk about
- Mario: this is most important

### Stop boring project
- Francis: This week project was boring, not alot of features
- Rabea: I disagree, most important thing was collaboration, projects that are too hard would distract
- Yusef: You have to make the best of it
- Ivan: It's up to you to make the best of it
- Mario: Choose a more exciting topic than books
- Shireen: Autocomplete is very useful tool to know, and also you should be creative!

### Stop doing other things that are not the course
- Mario: Disrepectful to have your phone out while you're in meeting with other people, you should try to get the most out of the course

## Go

### Personal bottles instead of plastic cups
- Mario: Could we bring bottles / cups instead of plastic cups
- Rabea: we need to be able to wash up cups
- Shireen: I'll sort something

### Water cooler
- Shireen: working on it

### Glass cups
- Mario: don't trust myself not to smash it

### Shared presentations (research and project)
- Mahmod: We take too long
- Najwan: I personally don't learn much from other peoples research
- Rabea: This is something you will have to do in a job, we're here to learn other skills than coding
- Mario: Limited to 10mins 
- Shireen: remember to put examples in research presentations
- Mario: Should we build you a template of what presentation should looks like?


### All team members should talk during presentations
- Jamie: It's really good practice for everyone to talk
